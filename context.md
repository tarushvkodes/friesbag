# Fries Bag Game - Development Plan

## Game Concept
A fun and simple browser-based game where players need to catch falling french fries in a paper bag. The game will test players' reflexes and timing.

## Core Mechanics
1. A paper bag that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen (controlled by arrow keys or mouse)
2. French fries falling from the top of the screen at random positions
3. Score tracking based on caught fries
4. Lives system (fries that hit the ground reduce lives)
5. Increasing difficulty over time (faster falling fries)

## Technical Requirements
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- CSS for UI styling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Local storage for high scores

## Game Features
1. Main menu screen
2. Game screen with:
   - Score display
   - Lives remaining
   - Current level/speed
3. Game over screen with:
   - Final score
   - High score
   - Restart option
